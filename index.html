        <h2>My primary goal is to raise awareness about kidney failure, educate about kidney health, and offer support to those affected by kidney disease.</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, Uzma Ansari here! I have provided my entire journey of a successful kidney transplant. This journey has not only transformed my life but also strengthened my determination to help others who are facing similar challenges. Through my personal experience, I want to offer encouragement and ways to improve your health, especially for those living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).The transplant itself was a turning point in my life, but it didnâ€™t mark the end of my journey.It was just the beginning of a new chapter that required even more commitment to self-care.

        Hi Everyone, My name is Uzma Khatun and I am a Computer Science Engineer.After completing my engineering, I went to the hospital for a blood test on 24th July 2022 because I was experiencing weakness,pain in leg and shoulder, vomiting, loss of hunger, trouble in sleeping and heavy weight loss.In report i have found about my both kidney failure. My creatinine level was 6, my serum urea was 240, and I had only 6 units of blood in my body. After 2 years of struggle, I finally underwent a kidney transplant surgery in July 2024, and I am now completely fine.

      <p>Typically, every person has two kidneys, but some individuals are born with only one kidney. In both case, people can lead a normal life. Kidneys are main organs in the human body. They filter blood, remove waste products, regulate blood pressure, produce hormones essential for proper bodily functions, create an active form of vitamin D that promotes strong and healthy bones, and produce urine.</p> </div></div></section>

  <h2>There are two types of Kidney Failure.</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="Type-col">
      <h3>Acute Kidney Failure</h3>
      <p>This type of kidney failure occurs suddenly and can be reversible. It can be caused by a number of things, illness, drugs, dehydration, or blocked ureters.</p>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <p>1- High blood pressure.<br>2- Swelling in legs, feet.<br>3- Weakness.<br>4- Abnormal urination.</p>
      <h3>Cure (Treatment)</h3>
      <p>It can be recovered by medicine. Visit the nearest Nephrology department.</p>

    <div class="Type-col">
      <h3>Chronic Kidney Failure</h3>
      <p>In the earlier stages of CKD, there are often no signs. Symptoms usually appear in the later stages. This type of kidney failure develops slowly over at least three months and can lead to permanent kidney failure. It can be caused by a number of things, including diabetes, high blood pressure, or stones in the kidney.</p>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <p>1- High blood pressure.<br>2- Swelling in face, feet.<br>3- Weakness.<br>4- Trouble sleeping.<br>5- Shortness of breath.<br>6- Abnormal urination.<br>7- Vomiting.<br>8- Pain in legs & shoulder.<br>9- Lack of appetite(hunger).<br>10- Small size of kidneys.</p>
      <h3>Cure (Treatment)</h3>

      <h2>A creatinine level is a measurement of the amount of creatinine in your blood and is part of a Kidney Function Test (KFT). A normal creatinine level for adults is:<br>
      Men: 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL<br>Women: 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL<br>Serum urea normal range is up to 40. Serum BUN is half of the value of serum urea (In this case, up to 20 is normal). Report depends on the range.</h2>
