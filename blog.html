        <h1>Hi Everyone</h1>
   <p>Hello, my name is Uzma, and I am a Computer Science Engineer with a core interest in Web Development. I recently launched two websites that reflect my skills for this field. In addition to my work in web development, I serve as the TPO Coordinator and NCC Senior Under Officer( Rajasthan Directorate ), where I led and handled all the technical work for the online National Cadet Corps Camp (EBSB 4 Uttarakhand & Rajasthan)."I am always excited to explore new opportunities to learn, grow, and innovate in the world of technology.</p>

        <p>I have done my graduation from Rajasthan Technical University.Along with my degree i have joined NCC as senior under officer and i am qualified for SSB interview on merit based and NCC. My first SSb was in Banglore on 1 March 2022 but i could not perform well there due to my health and i have no idea about my health condition.I have huge weight loss in january 2022 but i could not focus on my health because i was preparing for my interview, I was taking classes from retired indian army colonel Sir and also i have joined Bank Coaching in Jaipur.So my all focus was on only studies. </p></div>

 <p> Slowly, as other symptoms began to appear, such as leg pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, I decided to go for a full body checkup. On July 24, after six months of symptoms, I was diagnosed with complete kidney failure. My creatinine level was 6, urea was 240, and my kidneys were found to be small. Additionally, I had only 6 units of blood.
There was no possible treatment except dialysis or a kidney transplant. Unfortunately, I made a huge mistake by opting for Ayurvedic and homeopathic treatments, which worsened my condition. On September 16, 2023, my health became critical due to water accumulation in my lungs, making my lungs invisible on the X-ray.
I underwent my first dialysis in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, and finally decided to go ahead with surgery.</p>

      <div class="blog-col">
        <p>I went to Chandan Hospital in Lucknow for surgery. Due to high creatinine levels, my heart muscles had become weak. The doctor advised me to take medication to improve my heart's pumping ability first, and once it improved, they would start the checkups for surgery.
However, even after several months, my heart's pumping ability did not improve. The cardiologist then suggested that it might recover after the transplant. Starting from May 20, 2024, the checkups began, and by June 30, all the preparations were completed. I received my surgery date in July, and I was admitted to the hospital a day before the procedure.
The next day, I underwent surgery, which lasted six hours. In the evening, I was shifted to the Kidney Transplant Unit (KTU). I experienced significant improvement within three days, and my creatinine levels returned to normal. I was discharged on the seventh day after surgery.</p>

        <p>
Now, six months have passed since the surgery, and I am doing well. I feel completely fine. !! I hope my journey has inspired you and provided you with valuable insights !! Explore treatment options, and find strength during their survival journey. My goal is to share helpful resources, motivational stories, and expert advice to empower others in managing chronic kidney disease and living a fulfilling life.</p>

  <h4> My Personal Experience</h4>
   <p>  Be brave in this situation. Those who dare to stand and stay motivated make themselves stronger than ever.  
     
    Life tests everyone, and you have been chosen to show your courageous, strongest, and toughest side.I know the feeling when we find out that one of our body organs is not doing well. We suffer physically, but mentally as well. However, you are not alone in this. There are doctors, loved ones, and a community that cares about you and is here to support you every step of the way. We have all gone through this phase, but now we are all fine. You will be fine too. When medical science gives us a chance to survive, please take itâ€”go for the transplant. After the surgery, you will find ways to take care of yourself, just as I am doing.<br></p>
