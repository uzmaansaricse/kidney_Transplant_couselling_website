        <h1>Dialysis & Its Types</h1>
        <h2>Dialysis is a process used to remove waste from your body and filter your blood when your kidneys are not functioning properly. It is very important for survival because if the kidneys are not working and you do not undergo dialysis, the creatinine level in your body will increase day by day, waste will accumulate, and this can ultimately lead to death.
So, don’t worry! Medical science has provided us with a way to continue living, so it’s essential to opt for dialysis if needed. Dialysis will continue for as long as you live.
There are mainly two types of dialysis.</h2>
        <h1>Hemodialysis</h1>
     <div class="row">
          <div class="Dailysis-col">
          <h3>Type 1</h3>
          <h4>1-From Thighs (leg)(For single day)<br></h4>
          <p>This is used for Emergency Dialysis<br>When a patient urgently needed a dialysis.<br>No need to worry Doctor give you na injection to numb your theighs.        </p>
          <h3>Prevention</h3>
          <p>Do not move your leg while Dialysis.Else blood flow will be disturbed</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Dailysis-col">
         <h3>Type 2</h3>
         <h4>1-From Neck(1 month)<br></h4>
         <p>Its not painful overall but can be used for dialysis as only for 1 month. there is a small catheter inserted through neck.<br></p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Prevent this from water Because it has high risk of Infection</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Dailysis-col">
         <h3>Type 3</h3>
         <h4>1-From chest (6 months)<br></h4>
         <p>When a person is going for Transplant they use this method for dialysis because a small catheter inserted through chest and it is easily removable and within time they got all tests for transplant so no need for surgury of hand fistula.<br></p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Prevent this from water high chance of infection due to water. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Dailysis-col">
        <h3>Type 4</h3>
        <h4>1-Hand Fistula (Permanent)<br></h4>
        <p>There is a very small surgery in hand above wrist area. This can be used over lifetime for Dialysis.<br></p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Prevent this hand from doing any kind of hard work (lifting weight)<br>Do not sleep over that hand else have to make another fistula <br></p>

        <h1>Peritonial Dialysis</h1>
        <h2>PD can be a good option for people who want more independence and are able to learn to treat themselves. It's also more physiological than intermittent hemodialysis and requires fewer dietary and fluid restrictions</h2>

         <h3>Type 1(CAPD)</h3>

  <h1>Points to Remember During Dialysis</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="points-col">
      <h4>
        There are a few points to keep in mind. I learned this after some months of dialysis, so I am sharing these important details here:</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
        1. <b>Potassium Removal</b> - Potassium is also removed during dialysis. You need to tell your doctor to remove potassium; they will attach a container to the dialysis machine. This is very important because high potassium levels can cause breathing problems.
        <br>
         <br>2. <b>Blood Flow Rate</b>  - Due to high creatinine, sometimes it affects other organs like the heart or liver. In my case, it was the heart. My heart was only pumping at 35%. If you feel pain or any discomfort near your heart, tell the doctor to reduce the blood flow rate. Generally, it is 220/230 or more, but I preferred 180.
        <br>
         <br>3. <b>Water Removal</b>  - As we know, during dialysis, we are allowed to drink only 1 liter of liquid in 24 hours because, due to kidney failure, most people cannot urinate. Drinking more water can cause swelling and breathing problems.
        <br>
         <br>4. <b>Weight Monitoring</b>  - Check your weight after dialysis and when you return for the next session. Calculate the extra weight and inform the doctor to remove the excess water from your body.
        <br>
         <br>5. <b>Eating During Dialysis</b>  - You can eat anything during dialysis. Bring your favorite food to the hospital, as everything gets filtered during the process, so there’s no need to worry.

  <h1>For people living on Dialysis</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="points-col">
      <h4>
        Some person's Kidney failure reason could not be identified by doctors so they can not be recieve a kidney, those people live on dialysis.<br> Here are some points which can help you to live a longer life. </h4>
        <br>
        <p>
        1.Go for dialysis regularly even if someone is with you or not . Take Iron and cresp injections to maintain blood level.
        <br>
         <br>2.After Dialysis eat boiled egg & paneer for energy.
        <br>
         <br>3. Water Removal</b> As we know, during dialysis, we are allowed to drink only 1 liter of liquid in 24 hours because, due to kidney failure, most people cannot urinate. Drinking more water can cause swelling and breathing problems.
        <br>
         <br>4. Entertain yourself and keep your mind happy. Try to maintain a healthy blood level, and this will only be possible when you are happy. Don't worry, we have all gone through this phase.
        <br>
         <br>5.Eat less spicy and less oily after dialysis and try to eat green vegetables more.<br>(Lauki, Ridge gourd(Turai), sponge gourd(Nenua), Kaddu, Bhindi)
